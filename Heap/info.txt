heap is a complete binary tree with heap order property 
complete means every binary tree is complete except the last level
evey level is filed from the left side 
the heap order property is of 2 types 
min heap and max heap
we can implement the heap using an array 
so for every node i its left child will be 2*i and right child will be 2*i+1
which points to parent at i/2 index;

insertion takes logn
deletion only from the root
replace the root node with the last node 
after it propoagte the root node to its correct position
deletion takes logn

Heapify 
in a complete binary tree the leaf index lies from n/2+1 to n index
you can neglect the n/2+1 to n part 
only process 1 to n/2 wala part

you can use priority queue in stl for min max heap data structures


too know if a binary tree is a heap you need to prove 2 things first that it is a complete binary tree and second it is a max heap
