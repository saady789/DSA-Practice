heap is a complete binary tree with heap order property 
complete means every binary tree is complete except the last level
evey level is filed from the left side 
the heap order property is of 2 types 
min heap and max heap
we can implement the heap using an array 
so for every node i its left child will be 2*i and right child will be 2*i+1
which points to parent at i/2 index;
