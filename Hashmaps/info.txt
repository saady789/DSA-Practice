in c++ the maps are implemented using binary search trees
the insertion time complexity is logn
the erase function also has time complexity of logn

we have unorederd map which have constant time complexity for insertion deletion and removal of the elemtns from the map it is implemented using hashing

in a multi map the duplicated keys are allowed
the time complexity is logn
implemented by binary trees

unorder multimap is implemented using hashes so the time complexity is 
constant


hash functions are a combinations of hashcode and compresssion algorithm
