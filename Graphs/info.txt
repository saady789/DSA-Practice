graph is a type of data strucutre consisting of nodes and edges 
node is an entity to store the data and edge is connecting the 2 nodes
Degree of a node = number of edges connected either in/out for undirected graphs
for directed graphs we have an indegree and an outdegree 
total degree of a graph = 2*total number of edges in a graph 


weighted graph means there are number of weight assigned to edges showing efforts to go from one node to another
by default if no weights are assigned then we can say that it is 1 

Path is a sequence of distinct nodes
cyclic directed graph
acyclic graph


Types of representation 
1) Adjacency Matrix 
2) Adjacency List

Topological sort: 
only on DAG directed acyclic graph 
it is never for undirected graphs 
it is also never for cyclic graphs 
it is the linear ordering of the vertices 
KAHNS algorithm
something before something 

Disjkstra Algorithm (Does not work for negative weights will give infinite distances)
Priority Queue 
Set 
Queue

Bellman Ford Algorithm is used to find shortest path and can also be used if the edges are negative 
works only for DG
single source shortest path 
Floyd Warshall Algo 
finds shortest path between every pair of vertices 
negative edges allowed but negative cycles are not allowed

Spanning Tree
a tree that has n nodes and n-1 edges
Minimum Spanning Tree is the spanning tree with minimum weights sum
